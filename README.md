# Robust Decision Making Under Uncertainty via Bounded Rationality and Differential Privacy

This repository contains the numerical experiments for the paper **[Robust Control Under Uncertainty via Bounded Rationality and Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08262) by Vincent Pacelli and Anirudha Majumdar**.

The code in this repository reproduces the precise results depicted in the paper, but documentation of the source code and experiments is still being actively updated.
